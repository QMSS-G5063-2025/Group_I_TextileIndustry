# About 

Inspiration for this project lies around 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) away from New York City, in one of the oldest and driest deserts in the world â€“ the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. From a distance, mounts of clothing and textile scraps seemingly blend in with the dunes and dry hills in the landscape. From up close, bright colors begin to stand out from discarded ripped jeans, leather boots, heals and old bracelets against the warm desert sand. 

The Cemetery of Clothes, as the locals refer to it, is a reflection of the effects of overproduction, fast fashion and a lack of policy regulations on the textile industry. An estimated 59,000 tons of clothing and other textiles are imported to Chile each year, of which almost 40,000 deemed [irrecoverable](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/8/chiles-desert-dumping-ground-for-fast-fashion-leftovers). The growing piles permeate serious environmental impacts on the land, releasing toxic chemicals, like methane and formaldehyde, and contaminating the ground with imparishable microplastics. Fast fashion clothing is mainly made out of polyester (plastic), which is [non-biodegradable](https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/). With no proper management nor supervision, The Cemetery also presents an inevitable fire hazard as it spreads across 741 acres (300 hectares) of arid land.
