## Textile Industry and Fast Fashion:   

The textile industry stands at a critical juncture, facing unprecedented scrutiny for its unsustainable practices and detrimental impact on the environment. As one of the world's largest consumer industries, aspects such as fashion production cycles, distribution networks and waste are key aspects to construct an overview of the current situation. In the era of social-platform-fueled microtrends and unparalleled mass production, it is important to process and present appealing information to increase awareness on the pressing need for sustainable solutions across different areas of the textile network. 

Our objective is to create a sample overview of the textile industry with a critical perspective, including data from different topics: import/export share, waste exportation, consumer behaviour, and much more).   

This web page provides information and interactive data visualizations where the user can explore different components of the textile industry, on a global and local scale. Visualizations facilitate comparison between countries and aid in story telling.
